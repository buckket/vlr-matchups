                        In short this website processes the most viewed Valorant streams on Twitch.tv and tries to
                        figure out
                        which persons are either playing with, or against each other, just by looking at the score and
                        team composition.
                        The results are then displayed here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Source code is now available on GitHub.

                    <h2>Limitations</h2>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Currently, the search is limited to the 100 most viewed
                            <del>English</del>
                            streams.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <del>
                                The scraper expects the normal/correct aspect ratio of all on-screen assets.
                                If someone is playing with weird resolutions or aspect ratios the scraper is having
                                troubles.
                                Could be fixed by trying to figure out which resolution is used and compensating
                                afterwards.
                            </del>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If information is obscured by overlays there's no chance to ever retrieve it. Obviously.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Haven’t gone through the trouble to find the game screen inside another container.
                            So if the streamer is using borders or some fancy Picture in Picture magic we’re out of
                            luck, for now.
                        </li>

                    </p>
                    <h2>Performance</h2>
                    <p>
                        It’s written in Python, the OpenCV part is terribly slow, the rest is okay-ish.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How slow? About one minute to process 100 streams on a dusty old 2.7 GHz Intel i5. Problem is:
                        Only one core gets used. Ever.
                        One could easily shift all the CPU and memory intensive parts to a separate C++ program later
                        and make use of all cores, but for ease of development it was best to stay within Python for as
                        long as possible.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Why</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cause I find it amusing watching a match from both sides simultaneously. Also: It was fun
                        developing.
